<p>Woven Carbon Fiber (Standard 2x2 or 3k) - the most common carbon fiber weave. 2x2 weave woven carbon fiber is the default if listing does not specify the pattern. Woven 3K carbon fiber is a lightweight and high-strength material made from bundles of 3,000 carbon filaments (referred to as "3K") that are woven into a fabric pattern, typically in a twill or plain weave. It offers excellent tensile strength, stiffness, and durability while maintaining a sleek, smooth appearance with a distinctive checkerboard pattern.</p><p> </p>
<p><u>Forged (20% extra charge, made to order):</u></p>
<p>Forged carbon fiber - a composite material made from randomly arranged, short carbon fiber strands combined with resin and compressed in a mold. Forged carbon fiber offers greater design flexibility compared to 3K woven carbon fiber, as it can be molded into more complex shapes without compromising structural integrity. Its random fiber orientation reduces weak points caused by the directional patterns in 3K weaves, enhancing impact resistance. Additionally, it has a unique aesthetic appeal, with a marbled texture that stands out from the uniform weave of 3K carbon fiber.</p><p> </p>
<p><u>Honeycomb (20% extra charge, made to order):</u></p>
<p>Honeycomb carbon fiber - combines woven 3K carbon fiber layers with a lightweight honeycomb weave, creating a sandwich structure that offers exceptional stiffness-to-weight ratio. This configuration provides excellent rigidity, impact resistance, and thermal insulation, making it ideal for aerospace, automotive, and high-performance sporting applications. The honeycomb weave significantly reduces material weight while maintaining strength, making it a preferred choice for lightweight structural components.</p><p><br><br>*To place order for other bespoke or creative options, please email or call in.</p>
