                    <p>Woven Carbon Fiber (Standard 2x2 or 3k) - the most common carbon fiber weave. 2x2 weave woven
                        carbon fiber is the default if listing does not specify the pattern. Woven 3K carbon fiber
                        is a lightweight and high-strength material made from bundles of 3,000 carbon filaments
                        (referred to as "3K") that are woven into a fabric pattern, typically in a twill or plain
                        weave. It offers excellent tensile strength, stiffness, and durability while maintaining a
                        sleek, smooth appearance with a distinctive checkerboard pattern.</p>

                    <p><u>Forged (20% extra charge, made to order):</u></p>
                    <p>Forged carbon fiber - a composite material made from randomly arranged, short carbon fiber
                        strands combined with resin and compressed in a mold. Forged carbon fiber offers greater
                        design flexibility compared to 3K woven carbon fiber, as it can be molded into more complex
                        shapes without compromising structural integrity. Its random fiber orientation reduces weak
                        points caused by the directional patterns in 3K weaves, enhancing impact resistance.
                        Additionally, it has a unique aesthetic appeal, with a marbled texture that stands out from
                        the uniform weave of 3K carbon fiber.</p>
